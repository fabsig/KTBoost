Description: # KTBoost
        
        This package implements several boosting algorithm. In particular, this 
        includes tree and kernel boosting as well as the combined KTBoost algorithm. The package
        supports both gradient and Newton boosting updates as well as a hybrid version of the two
        for trees. Further, the package implements several loss functions which inlucdes 
        the Tobit likelihood (i.e. the Grabit model).
        The package is an extenion of scikit-learn and re-uses code from
        scikit-learn.
